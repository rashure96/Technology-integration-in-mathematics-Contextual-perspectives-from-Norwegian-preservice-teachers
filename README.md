This repository contains the extracted qualitative data and associated coding required to fully reproduce the results reported in the paper:

Technology integration in mathematics: Contextual perspectives from Norwegian preservice teachers,
submitted to the International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology.

The repository includes coded data prepared to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis while protecting participant confidentiality. A DOI for the published article will be added here upon publication: [DOI: to be added].


Data File Description:
This data file contains all extracted qualitative quotes together with their assigned codes. The “Raw Files” column identifies the original data source from which each quote was taken.

Coding follows a hierarchical structure, which is reflected directly in the code names. Higher-level codes appear as broad categories (e.g.,
Codes\Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)), while more specific sub-codes are nested within these categories (e.g.,
Codes\Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)\PCK1 – Knowledge to use learning strategies to enhance mathematical content). The table is fully filterable, allowing users to examine code frequencies and distributions at any level of the coding hierarchy.

Due to data protection and ethical considerations, the original raw transcripts and logbook copies cannot be shared. However, this table provides a complete and transparent representation of the qualitative analysis. The structure and content of the table make the entire analysis presented in the paper fully reproducible, and all descriptive tables reported in the paper can be regenerated directly from this dataset.

The original qualitative analysis was conducted using NVivo. The present data file is an extraction from the NVivo project, prepared to ensure methodological transparency while removing or anonymizing all sensitive information.
