# Repository Overview

This repository contains the extracted qualitative data and associated coding required to **fully reproduce the results** reported in the paper:

> **Technology integration in mathematics: Contextual perspectives from Norwegian preservice teachers**  
> *Submitted to the* **International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology**

The repository includes coded data prepared to ensure **transparency and reproducibility** of the analysis while protecting participant confidentiality.

## Data File Description

This data file contains all extracted qualitative quotes together with their assigned codes. The **“Raw Files”** column identifies the original data source from which each quote was taken.

### Coding Structure

Coding follows a **hierarchical structure**, which is reflected directly in the code names:

- **Higher-level codes** represent broad analytical categories, for example:  
  `Codes\Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)`

- **Lower-level sub-codes** are nested within these categories, for example:  
  `Codes\Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)\PCK1 – Knowledge to use learning strategies to enhance mathematical content`

The table is fully **filterable**, allowing users to examine code frequencies and distributions at any level of the coding hierarchy.

## Data Protection and Reproducibility

Due to data protection and ethical considerations, the original raw transcripts and logbook copies cannot be shared. However, this table provides a **complete and transparent representation** of the qualitative analysis.

The structure and content of the table make the entire analysis presented in the paper **fully reproducible**, and all descriptive tables reported in the paper can be regenerated directly from this dataset.

## Software and Data Extraction

The original qualitative analysis was conducted using **NVivo**.  
The present data file is an extraction from the NVivo project, prepared to ensure **methodological transparency** while removing or anonymizing all sensitive information.
